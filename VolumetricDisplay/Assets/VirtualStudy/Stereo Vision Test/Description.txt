Please DOWNLOAD the set of D_SA test images for your screen resolution and dimension.

The archive contains 6 stereoscopic images of the test scene:

    3 versions of the test scene are provided, presenting the target in the left, center or right position
    for each position it is provided an image with 1 or 2 pixels of disparity

To perform the test, create a sequence of 10 images, with a random alternation of the target position. Please show a black background for 2 seconds between each test image.
For each target image, change the observer distance from the screen following the table below (take care to use the image with the correct pixel disparity value for each position).

With a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels and width of 80 cm, the viewing distances are:

Disparity (arc sec)	Disparity (pixel)	Distance from the screen (cm)
160	2	107
100	2	171
63	2	272
50	2	343
