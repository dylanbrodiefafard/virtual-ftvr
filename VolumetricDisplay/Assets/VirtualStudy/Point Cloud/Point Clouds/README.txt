Points were represented as shaded cubes colored light gray
Environment was 10 x 10 x 10 cm

Point Distance: Which of the point pairs are closer to each other: the red pair or the yellow pair?
Error is binary. was the correct pair found?
Randomly generated points on a regular grid of 30 x 30 x 30 possible discrete positions with a point density of 1.5% (135 points)
Two pairs of points were randomly selected such that the spatial (Euclidean) distance between the first pair of points was 20% shorter than the distance between the second pair.

Point Selection: Select all red points as fast as you can. Selected points turn blue.
Randomly distributed points and 4 red targets.
Random points on a 20x20x20 regular grid with 10% point density. 4 target points were randomly selected from this set.
Error is the number of clicks that did not select a target point.

Cluster Estimation: What is the minimum number of clusters that you can count when looking from all three orthogonal viewing directions?
Error is binary. Did the participant find the correct answer?
Noise points were randomly placed within a 30 x 30 x 30 grid with 0.25% density (approx 67 points).
Cluster count and cluster centroid positions were manually set to be evenly distrivuted and to provide respective overlap-conditions required for the task.
30 points per cluster based on a random Gaussian distribvution with a standard deviation of 2.
Participants saw data sets with 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 clusters.
Wireframe of the bounding box was shown

Cutting Plane: Place the cutting plane so that it touches all three clusters of red points. Points in the cluster touched by the cutting plane turns blue.
Noise points and 3 clusters of red points ranomly positioned.
randomly samples points from a regular 15 x 15 x 15 grid with a density of 30%. 
Cluster centroid positions were randomly generated such that each pair was 10 units away from each other.
Each cluster had 10 points whose positions are defined by a random Gaussian distribution with standard deviation of 0.5 units.
Wireframe of the bounding box was shown
Accuracy was calculated as sum of the distance of each cluster's geometric center to the cutting plane.
